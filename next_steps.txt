# Using a LJ reference potential (note, "***" indicates either code development needed or a complicated step: 

1. Update He and Ar .xyzf files to include energies and stresses
2. ***Verify the codes work properly when energies included in fits
3. ***Update .py script to accept fit weights
4. For the He-only and Ar-only .xyzfs, individually, perform a Od and weight optimization to determine what is needed to get the PES correct, in addition to force parity
5. For the Ar+He.xyz file, fitting energies and forces, perform Oe and Od optimization to determine what is needed to get the PES correct, in addition to force parity
6. Repeat witht he Ar + He + Ar/He .xyzf file
7. Create .xyzf files for O2, N2, Cl2, and Br2 under non-reactive conditions
8. ***Update codes with hyperparameters for O, N, Cl, and Br
9. Fit .xyzfs from 7 individually (Od optimization, confirm PES and force parity)
10. Create .xyzf files for non-reactive mixtures of step 7
11. Fit .xyzf files from 10
12. Create a non-reactive mixture of mono- and di-atomic systems
13. Fit .xyzf files from 12
14. ***Implement ability to run dynamics with alchemical models
15. For all good models generated to date, run dynamics, compare results with LJ simulations
16. ***Identify a purely 2-bodied reactive potential implemented in LAMMPS; test this method for reactive systems
17. ***Extend code to 3-body systems, including need for permuational invariance
18. Apply the 3b code to class-2 LJ UA propane (non-reactive) and class-2 LJ UA 1-flouroethane
19. Apply to DFT water under ambient conditions (from 2nd ChIMES paper)
